Intro:
This project was a group university project which made use of popular programs such as Git and Pycharm to develop a working chatbot in which we name Sven. Based around the game Minecraft, this chatbot enables responses to questions about crafting recipes, thier descriptions and other standard chat responses all incorporated within both discord and the Minecraft chat itself, hosted on a server.

Short Summary:
My contributions to the project were:
-Using Scrum methodology with the website 'Trello' to keep track of overall progress as well as setting additional tasks.
-Using Python (Pycharm) to develop an input refactor to modify the input by parsing each word individually into an simplified interpretable 2d Numpy array with its word, amount of times the word occurs and type of word (noun). This was done by referencing a corporus using NLTK.
-Using Python and SSH on a server to install Minecraft Bukkit and link the program using the plugin RaspberryJuice which allows python to communicate using server ports.


Overall:
During my project I was able to; enhance my skills with GitHub being able to work side by side with other programmers, learn how to use Pycharm as the most popular IDE, work as a team effectively by program in modules rather than linearly, develop my object oriented skills in python allowing code to communicate more efficiently as well as develop my Agile skills using methods like the Kanban board, paired programming and Scrum meetings.
